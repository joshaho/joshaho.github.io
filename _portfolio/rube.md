Integrating science into high school classrooms, and getting students excited about practical applications for material learned is something I see as important. When I was asked in 2015 to come onboard with the Abbotsford School for the Integrated Arts with their Rube Goldberg project, it seemed like a natural progression.

The project consisted of converting the entire school into an "over-engineered" device to do a simple task. This turned into an exercise in modular planning, inter-disiplinary collaboration, and applied physics and engineering.

My role there was to give insight into ways to execute student ideas, and provide assistance with testing and troubleshooting. Students would have a clear vision of what they wanted to do (for example, a sequence that told the story of "The Wizard of Oz"), but couldn't quite figure out the technical details in order to provide the seamless motion needed for the machine.
