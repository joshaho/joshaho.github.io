In radiation therapy for cancer treatment, patient setup is critical  for ensuring accurate dose delivery to the target. This setup relies on precise alignment between a system of lasers, embedded in the walls and ceiling of the treatment room, and the isocentre, the point where the linear accelerator beam intersects regardless of its starting angle relative to the treatment couch. The laser setup is prone to slight shifts  over time, requiring daily checks and periodic calibration. In this paper, we present a camera-based laser calibration device that directly compares laser positions with a reference position provided as a light pattern projected by the linear accelerator. This decreases the setup time required for calibration compared to using a manual reference device and can automatically correct any detected offset in the lasers' positions.
